# Firefox

![Firefox Logo](firefoxlogo.png)

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is my main browser. I switched to it initially from Google Chrome because Chrome would not let me screenshot images from an Udemy course.

## Settings

I have the following settings modified in `about:config`

- `browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab = false` - This prevents the browser window from closing when the last tab is closed.
