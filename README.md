# My Windows OS

A list of applications and setings that make my Windows experience easier. This repository is inspired by [Nikita Voloboev](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) and [Omar Bahareth](https://github.com/obahareth/my-mac-os). I first started this simply to store information about my Firefox `about:config` settings after learning about that feature from [Šime](https://šime.eu/3)

## Applications

### Browsers

- [Firefox](applications/firefox) - my main browser.
